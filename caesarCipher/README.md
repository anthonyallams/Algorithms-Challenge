# CHALLENGE

Given a ROT13 encoded capitalized string, write a function that takes it as input and returns a decoded string. In ROT13 cipher, the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.

## EXAMPLE

    rot13("LBH QVQ VG!") should output "YOU DID IT"
    rot13("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ") should output "NOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLM"
    rot13("URYYB") should output "HELLO"

## BEST PRACTICES

    1. Ensure the code is readable and maintainable
    2. Ensure the code is clean, commented and properly linted
    3. Ensure the code is scalabile
    4. Ensure code is tested
