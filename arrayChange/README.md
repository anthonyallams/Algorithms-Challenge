# CHALLENGE

    Given an array of integers, on each move you are allowed to increase exactly one of its elements by one. Find the minimal no of moves required to obtain a strictly increasing sequence from the input.
    The min number of moves needed to obtain a strictly increasing sequence from inpuy array. In other words, change arrayChange([1,1,1]) to arrayChange([1,2,3]) and get the difference which is 3.

## EXAMPLE

    arrayChange([1,1,1]) ==> 3
    arrayChange([1,2,2,1]) ==> 4
    arrayChange([1,1,1,1,1]) ==> 10
