# CHALLENGE

    Given an array of integers, find the maximum possible sum of some of its k consecutive elements

## EXAMPLE

    For inputArray = [2,3,5,1] and k = 2. the output should be arrayMaxConsecutiveSum(inputArray, k) = 8. All possible sums of two consecutive numbers are:
    2 + 3 = 5
    3 + 5 = 8
    5 + 1 = 6
    1 + 6 = 7
